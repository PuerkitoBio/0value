<p>I started using Linux more seriously around 2010, with Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat), if memory serves me well, although I did play around with Corel&rsquo;s Linux way back when. Since then, I tried a variety of distros and Unixes, such as Fedora and FreeBSD, but it wasn&rsquo;t until early 2015 that I first installed Arch Linux. At the time, I purchased a used 13&rdquo; Asus Zenbook on ebay specifically to toy with different distros without risk for my work laptop. I quickly started appreciating Arch Linux&rsquo; minimalist approach where you can relatively easily configure your distro to your liking, backed by an amazing wiki, rolling updates and an extensive, user-friendly package manager.</p>

<h2>The Switch To Macbook Pro</h2>

<p>I work as a freelance Go developer, and the overwhelming development platform of choice for the clients I work with - mostly startups - is macOS, so to make it easier for me to integrate to development teams (tools, setup, sharing installation information, etc.), my work machine is a mid-2015 13&rdquo; Macbook Pro. I also think it is the best laptop - the best computer - I&rsquo;ve ever had, for my needs. I work remotely, so the form factor makes it a great portable machine to go work in libraries, coffee shops or in a park during summer, and the battery life is good enough to be away from an outlet for an extended period of time (although not quite an entire work day). I also love the trackpad and keyboard.</p>

<p>So when the old Zenbook&rsquo;s screen died I started considering buying another laptop, but what I really wanted was that great macbook hardware paired with my personal favorite OS. But I still didn&rsquo;t want to take away what little disk space I had for my work (128GB SSD) to dual-boot, and I wasn&rsquo;t interested in running in a VM. I had a 120GB Lacie USB drive around, so I figured I might as well install Arch on it and not touch my internal disk at all.</p>

<h2>The Installation</h2>

<p>Basic setup is pretty straightforward and closely follows the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide">installation wiki page</a>. Mac-specific steps I had to make were (keep in mind that other approaches may work too, but this worked for me and my specific configuration):</p>

<ul>
<li>create an EFI partition for boot</li>
<li>setup boot to use <code>systemd-boot</code> (I installed Arch from a Virtual Box VM on macOS, and at this point I had to ensure the VM started in EFI mode, which hangs for <em>minutes</em> at startup, but ends up working - the Mac-specific instructions were documented in <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mac#Setup_bootloader">this wiki page</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot#Configuration">configure the Arch Linux entry in the bootloader</a></li>
<li>when configuring <code>mkinitcpio.conf</code>, I had to make sure the <code>block</code> hook was before <code>autodetect</code> <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/769047/unable-to-find-root-device-on-a-fresh-archlinux-install">as explained on superuser.com</a>, otherwise I had the error mentioned in the question. I also use <code>systemd</code> instead of <code>udev</code>, so my <code>HOOKS</code> look like this: <code>(base systemd block autodetect modconf filesystems keyboard fsck)</code></li>
<li>configure the pacman mirrorlist (<code>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</code>) and install some basic packages to get started: <code>pacman -S vim base-devel terminus-font dialog wpa_supplicant git openssh</code></li>
<li>because the Mac&rsquo;s resolution is so high, the console font is way too small for me by default, so <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Linux_console#Fonts">I played around with <code>setfont</code></a> until I found something I liked, and persisted the setting in <code>/etc/vconsole.conf</code> (I set it to <code>FONT=ter-v28n</code>, but keep in mind that I&rsquo;m in my forties&hellip;)</li>
<li>create my user, set a password and add myself to the sudoers (I added my user to the <code>wheel</code> group and uncommented <code>%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL</code> in <code>visudo</code>)</li>
<li>next came <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mac#Wi-Fi">network configuration</a>, which was a bit of a pain because <code>lspci</code> is not accurate in the VM, so there were some back and forth between the real OS and the VM to get internet access to install the driver; my macbook pro has a Broadcom 43602 card and the <code>b43-firmware (AUR)</code> package works for me.</li>
</ul>

<p>This results in a working console-based system, and although there&rsquo;s much configuration to be done next, the rest is much more subjective. At this point, booting the macbook with the USB drive plugged in and the <code>option</code> key pressed shows the bootloader menu with the option to select the EFI Arch Linux bootloader.</p>

<h2>The Customization</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the real fun begins. I&rsquo;m not a gamer, when I use a computer I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m <em>at least</em> 90% of the time either at the terminal or in a web browser. I have very little use for other GUI-based applications, except <code>Keepassxc</code> (and that&rsquo;s because I used a poor naming scheme when I created my password database otherwise I&rsquo;d use its command-line interface).</p>

<p>I implemented a very personal bash-based &ldquo;framework&rdquo; to manage my dotfiles (and more, config files, bashrc, aliases, etc.) so at this point making a system feel at home only requires cloning that repo and hooking it up so it runs on login. It also takes care of installing the packages I want from the start on an Arch system. For me, the main ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>xorg-server</code> &amp; co. for the graphical environment.</li>
<li><code>i3-gaps</code> as my window manager - I don&rsquo;t need any heavyweight desktop environment such as KDE or Gnome. I use <code>i3blocks</code> for the status bar and <code>dmenu</code> as application launcher.</li>
<li>the automatically detected resolution wasn&rsquo;t quite right (can&rsquo;t remember what it was exactly, but everything was way too small), so I had to add <code>Xft.dpi: 192</code> in my <code>Xresources</code> file.</li>
<li><code>cower</code> to handle AUR packages, along with some handy aliases because I always forget how to use it.</li>
<li><code>nitrogen</code> for my wallpaper, with lots of <a href="https://twitter.com/evilbmcats">Black Metal Cat</a> pictures to randomly choose from.</li>
<li><code>kitty</code> for my terminal.</li>
<li><code>adobe-source-code-pro-fonts</code> because I&rsquo;m used to Source Code Pro as terminal font.</li>
<li>a bunch of other font packages so that web pages look good (<code>ttf-mac-fonts</code> in AUR, <code>ttf-croscore</code> for substitutes to Windows fonts, etc.)</li>
<li><code>google-chrome</code> (AUR) and <code>firefox</code>.</li>
<li>a terminal-based mail setup using <code>isync</code> (mbsync) to sync my Gmail locally, <code>msmtp</code> to send email, <code>notmuch</code> to index my emails, and <code>alot</code> as terminal-based mail agent. I have a user systemd service running regularly to automatically sync this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It&hellip; Just Works?</h2>

<p>Okay so you really have to do a lot of manual set-up, few things work automatically out-of-the-box, but with a bit of work, I think pretty much <em>everything works</em>? Let&rsquo;s see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Screen looks great. Like, sometimes I forget if I&rsquo;m in macOS or Arch, I&rsquo;ll move the mouse to the top and wait for an apple menu to appear.</li>
<li>Trackpad works great too, not quite as versatile as on macOS, but still works really well (it is a bit more forgiving on macOS if too much of the finger drags on it). I use <code>libinput</code> to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mac#Keyboard_.26_Trackpad">enable natural scrolling</a> so I&rsquo;m not all confused when switching OS.</li>
<li>Function keys work, namely the screen brightness, keyboard brightness and volume keys. I haven&rsquo;t bothered doing anything with the other ones, but I&rsquo;m pretty confident they could be made to work easily enough.</li>
<li>As mentioned, brightness works, <code>acpilight</code> provides keyboard brightness and <code>pommed-light</code> (AUR) handles screen brightness.</li>
<li>Sound works, I used <code>ALSA</code> for the sound, and an <code>xbindkeys</code> file to map the volume function keys to <code>amixer</code> increase/decrease/toggle. Headphones work too.</li>
<li>Camera works, with <code>bcwc-pcie-git</code> and <code>facetimehd-firmware</code> packages (both AUR).</li>
<li>Sleep/resume works, without anything special that I can recall.</li>
<li>HDMI works with <code>xrandr</code>, I even configured i3 with a specific layout when an HDMI screen is plugged in so I can work with two monitors.</li>
<li>Bluetooth works with <code>bluez</code> and <code>bluez-utils</code> to use <code>bluetoothctl</code> command-line tool to pair a device. Apple&rsquo;s Magic Trackpad works fine.</li>
<li>Printing works with <code>cups</code> and the <code>hplip</code> driver for my wi-fi HP printer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really, I can&rsquo;t think of anything I use on my Macbook Pro that doesn&rsquo;t work under Arch Linux (I haven&rsquo;t tried the card reader nor the thunderbolt ports). And unlike under macOS where I struggle to maintain 10-15GB of free disk space, on my Arch disk with all my emails synced locally, I still have just under 100GB free. I&rsquo;m really glad I didn&rsquo;t opt to buy a separate laptop, not only did I save a significant amount of money, I now have my favorite OS available on my favorite hardware.</p>
