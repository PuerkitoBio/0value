# My (Go-centric) Vim Setup

A while ago I was all about Sublime Text 2. Text editing was a solved thing. I bought my license, installed [`Package Control`][pckctrl] and never looked back. Bliss. Then came the beta version of Sublime Text 3, which was equally awesome (it broke a few things early on for Package Control, not sure how it's doing now, but I felt it was no big deal for a beta). I was still happily using ST2 for my day-to-day, but the question of buying a new license about a year after ST2 made me question my next move.

Don't get me wrong: ST2 (and presumably ST3, I haven't closely followed its evolution) is a wonderful text editor, worth every penny of the *circa* 60$ that I sent to a fellow programmer (I see it's now 70$, still worth it IMO). It's even *cheap* by today's monthly subscription-based SaaS standard (5$/month, if you do the math). It's just that, faced with a decision, I decided to keep an open mind and look at alternatives, especially knowing that free behemoths - in every sense of *free* and of *behemoths* - `emacs` and `vim` - were touted by many respected knights of the curly braces. Long story short, I dove into emacs' daunting manual, came back impressed by the kill ring but never really clicked, while armed with a Vim cheat sheet, [Yan Pritzker's post][speak] and an indomitable will, I truly found my home with Vim.

The next step was to bring some productivity-enhancing tools in the mix, but not too much. Just the right balance. This is the result of quite a few googling safaris, and hopefully it can prove helpful to others wanting to write (mainly) Go code in Vim. I'm sure this is just scratching the surface of what can be done, and text editing being the subjective beast that it is, YMMV, but here goes, without further ado, I present to you my glorious Vim setup!
